- **Motion Theories**
Implementations of following motion theories are used:
  - **VSOP87**, full version, is used for calculating of major planets positions
  - **ELP2000**, truncated version (from Meeus' book) for calculation of Moon position
  - **GUST86** is used for calculating positions of major satellites of Uranus
