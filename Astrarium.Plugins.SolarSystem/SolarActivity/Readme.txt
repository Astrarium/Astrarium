                          SOLAR REGION SUMMARY (SRS)

  The Solar Region Summary (SRS), compiled by SWPC, is a daily report of 
  the active solar regions observed during the preceding day. The SRS
  contains a detailed description of the active regions currently visible
  on the solar disk. See sample and description below.

  The characteristics for each active region are compiled from up to six
  observatories that report to the SWPC in near-real time. The sunspot 
  counts are typically higher than those reported in non-real time by the
  Sunspot Index Data Center (SIDC), Brussels, Belgium, and the American 
  Association of Variable Star Observers.

The last 75 daily Solar Region Summary reports are included in this directory.
   Issue time:     Daily at 0030 UTC  It is usually on-line by 0040 UTC.
   Period covered: Previous UTC day.

====================================================
======   Description:


   Part I. Describes all active regions with sunspot groups:

Nmbr:     An SESC region number assigned to a sunspot group during its 
          disk passage. Note: The Solar Region Number reached 10,000 in 
	  July 2002. However, SWPC products continue to use 4-digit region 
	  numbers, with leading zeros.

Location: Sunspot group location, in heliographic degrees latitude and 
          degrees east or west from central meridian, rotated to 2400 UTC.

Lo:       Carrington longitude of the group.

Area:     Total corrected area of the group in millionths of the solar 
          hemisphere.

Z:        Modified Zurich classification of the group.


LL:       Longitudinal extent of the group in heliographic degrees.

NN:       Total number of visible sunspots in the group.

Mag Type: Magnetic classification of the group.


   Part IA. Describes previously numbered active regions which still 
            contain plage but no visible sunspots.

Nmbr:     SESC region number.

Location: Plage region location in heliographic degrees latitude and 
          degrees east or west from central meridian rotated to 2400 UTC.

Lo:       Carrington longitude of the region.


   PART II. Active regions that where observed on the previous solar 
            rotation and are due to reappear on the East limb in the 
            next 3 days.

Nmbr:     SESC region number.

Lat:      Heliographic degrees latitude of the group on its last disk 
          passage.

Lo:       Carrington longitude of the group on its last disk passage.

The 3 component McIntosh classification (McIntosh, Sol. Phys. 125, 251-267,1990) is based on the general form 'Zpc', where 'Z' is the modified Zurich Class, 'p' describes the penumbra of the principal spot, and 'c' describes the distribution of spots in the interior of the group.

There are 60 valid McIntosh classifications (see table).
Examples: Dao, Eao, Ekc, Fai, Fkc, Fko.

 Z-values: (Modified Zurich Sunspot Classification). 
    A - A small single unipolar sunspot. Representing either the
	formative or final stage of evolution.
    B - Bipolar sunspot group with no penumbra on any of the
        spots.  
    C - A bipolar sunspot group. One sunspot must have penumbra. 
    D - A bipolar sunspot group with penumbra on both ends of 
        the group. Longitudinal extent does not exceeds 10 deg.
    E - A bipolar sunspot group with penumbra on both ends. 
        Longitudinal extent exceeds 10 deg. but not 15 deg. 
    F - An elongated bipolar sunspot group with 
        penumbra on both ends. Longitudinal extent 
	of penumbra exceeds 15 deg. 
    H - A unipolar sunspot group with penumbra. 
 p-values:
    x - no penumbra (group class is A or B)
    r - rudimentary penumbra partially surrounds the largest spot.
        This penumbra is incomplete, granular rather than filamentary,
	brighter than mature penumbra, and extends as little as 3 arcsec
	from the spot umbra. Rudimentary penumbra may be either in a 
	stage of formation or dissolution. 
    s - small, symmetric (like Zurich class J). Largest spot has mature,
        dark, filamentary penumbra of circular or elliptical shape with
	little irregularity to the border. The north-south diameter 
	across the penumbra is less or equal than 2.5 degrees.
    a - small, asymmetric. Penumbra of the largest spot is irregular in 
        outline and the multiple umbra within it are separated. The 
	north-south diameter across the penumbra is less or equal than 
	2.5 degrees.
    h - large, symmetric (like Zurich class H). Same structure as type 
        's', but north-south diameter of penumbra is more than 2.5 
	degrees. Area, therefore, must be larger or equal than 250 
	millionths solar hemisphere.
    k - large, assymetric. Same structure as type 'a', but north-south 
        diameter of penumbra is more than 2.5 degrees. Area, therefore, 
	must be larger or equal than 250 millionths solar hemisphere.
 c-values
    x - undefined for unipolar groups (class A and H)
    o - open. Few, if any, spots between leader and follower. Interior 
        spots of very small size. Class E and F groups of 'open' 
	category are equivalent to Zurich class G.
    i - intermediate. Numerous spots lie between the leading and following
        portions of the group, but none of them possesses mature penumbra.
    c - compact. The area between the leading and the following ends 
        of the spot group is populated with many strong spots, with at least
	one interior spot possessing mature peanumbra. The extreme case of
	compact distribution has the entire spot group enveloped in one
	continuous prenumbral area.
